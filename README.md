Employee-Management-System
Welcome to the Employee Management System (EMS) — a sleek and simple admin dashboard built with ⚛️ React.js, ⚡ Vite, and 🎨 Tailwind CSS!

This project is designed to help admins easily 🧑‍💼 manage employee data — from adding new team members ✨ to editing details ✏️ or removing old records ❌. It includes a 🔐 secure login system to ensure that only authorized users can access the dashboard.

Built with a focus on speed, design, and usability, this EMS is responsive, fast, and super easy to use.
I'm currently learning and leveling up my full stack skills, and this project is a big step in my journey. Next up: connecting it to a real backend, adding JWT authentication, and making it production-ready!

If you like it, feel free to ⭐ the repo and follow along as I grow!
